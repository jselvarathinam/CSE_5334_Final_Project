# CSE_5334_Final_Project

This is my completed Final Project for Dr. Park's CSE 5334 class. The objective of this assignment was to build and train several different image classifiers using several different models/algorithms that could classify 6 different types of wild animals (cheetah, fox, hyena, lion, tiger, wolf), and determine which classifier worked the best. In order to train and test the classifiers, we were given a dataset hosted on Kaggle called "Wild Animals Images" which consisted of 1723 images of cheetahs, foxes, hyenas, lions, tigers, and wolves. The code for this project is contained in a Google Colab notebook. The notebook can be run simply by opening it in Colab and running all its cells.
