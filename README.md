# CSE_5334_Final_Project

This is my completed Final Project for Dr. Park's CSE 5334 class. The objective of this assignment was to build and train several different image classifier using several different models/algorithms that could classify 6 different types of wild animals (cheetah, fox, hyena, lion, tiger, wolf). In order to train and test the classifier we built we were given a dataset hosted on Kaggle called "Wild Animals Images" which consisted of 1723 images of cheetahs, foxes, hyenas, lions, tigers, and wolves. The code is contained in a Google Colab notebook. The notebook can be run simply by opening it in Colab and running all its cells.
